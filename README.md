# UPS-Tracker

> Tool for tracking multiple UPS shippings.

## Usage

### First time
* On the root, edit ``info.csv`` file with the shipping info you want to track.
* ``region`` field is just for setting the image name.
* Run ``npm run build``.
* Go to ``dist`` and run the executable.
* Wait until the script finishes and check ``/SCREENSHOOTS``.

### Next times
* Just edit the csv file on the root and run ``npm run csv`` or directly edit ``/dist/info.csv``.
* Go to ``dist`` and run the executable.
* Wait until the script finishes and check ``/SCREENSHOOTS``.
